# Automated Object Detection using DETR

Welcome to the Automated Object Detection project using DETR (DEtection Transfomer). This project utilizes the Facebook DETR model to create a user-friendly web service for automated object detection, with a primary focus on identifying cars within images.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-object-detection.git
    cd automated-object-detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Flask web service:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

The service will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

To request object detection on an image, you can use `curl`. Here's an example:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5000/detect_car
```

This will return a JSON response with information about detected cars. To visualize the results, you can use the provided `plot_results` function in your Python environment. Here's a sample code snippet:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import base64
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Replace 'your_encoded_image_data' with the actual base64-encoded image data received from the service
encoded_image_data = 'your_encoded_image_data'

# Decode the base64-encoded image data
decoded_image = base64.b64decode(encoded_image_data)

# Create a PIL Image from the decoded binary data
pil_image = Image.open(BytesIO(decoded_image))

# Display the image using matplotlib
plt.imshow(pil_image)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

Replace `'your_encoded_image_data'` with the actual base64-encoded image data received from the service.

**Notice: due to the payments of the EC2 server and low security of the service, I Stop the server and each time I start it, the publit IP is deferent, please contact me to provide you the IP adress.
